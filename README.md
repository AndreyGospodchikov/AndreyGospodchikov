ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gospodchikov Andrey (@AndreyGospodchikov)
Now I am working in a tech support team for "K3" CAD software:
k3-Cottage https://k3-cottage.ru/ and K3-Mebel https://k3-mebel.ru/

In addition to solving our users problems I am creating Python scripts for our software.

There is a https://github.com/AndreyGospodchikov/k3DevKit repository with open licensed Development Kit
useful in scripting our CAD systems

<!---
AndreyGospodchikov/AndreyGospodchikov is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
